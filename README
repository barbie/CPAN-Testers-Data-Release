         CREATE TABLE release (
             dist    text    not null,
             version text    not null,
             pass    integer not null,
             fail    integer not null,
             na      integer not null,
             unknown integer not null
         );

         CREATE INDEX release__dist ON release ( dist );
         CREATE INDEX release__version ON release ( version );
